# Comparative-Analysis-of-SVM-KNN-RandomForest-on-Handwriting-Recognition
Project involving Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbours and Random Forest classifiers to classificate handwriting letters from NIST Special Database 19. <br>
<br>
## Steps todo: <br>
1. Download dataset from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-srd/SD19/by_class.zip <br>
2. Unzip it <br>
3. Run resize_alphabet.py - it will centered photos at sign and change the resolution to 12x12 pixels and chose about 1500 of examples for each sign (randomly) <br>
4. open untitled.ipynb on jupyter notebook to check the accuracy score of the three machine learning models, and save it with name'RandomForestModel.pkl' (at repozitory i uploaded mine model with accuracy eauals 100%) <br>
5. Use jupyter notebook to check online how it works - just load model <br>
